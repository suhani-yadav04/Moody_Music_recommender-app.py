# Moody Music Recommender 🎧
Where your emotions meet melodies — a music companion that understands your mood.

It’s a small Streamlit app that takes a mood text input (like “calm”, “sad but hopeful”, “get me pumped”) and returns a ranked list of recommended songs from a small example dataset using TF-IDF + cosine similarity.

## 🌤️ Overview

**Mood Music Recommender** is an interactive web app that recommends songs based on your **current mood**.
Whether you’re feeling calm, nostalgic, joyful, or just vibing in between — this app matches your emotions with the perfect playlist.

It uses **natural language similarity** (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) to map mood descriptions to songs and presents you with personalized recommendations, along with album covers and quick links to play them.

Built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Python**, this lightweight app brings a touch of emotion to technology.

💛 **Beautiful, simple interface** with instant recommendations
📀 **Shows cover art, genre, and mood tags** for each track
🌈 **No API keys required** — all data is local and customizable
⚡ **Fast and fun** — runs smoothly even on small setups

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You type how you feel — for example:

   * *“chill and sleepy”*
   * *“heartbroken but hopeful”*
   * *“energetic and ready to go”*

2. The app compares your input with song descriptions in the dataset using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.

3. It then recommends songs whose “mood tags” and “vibe” most closely match your text.
